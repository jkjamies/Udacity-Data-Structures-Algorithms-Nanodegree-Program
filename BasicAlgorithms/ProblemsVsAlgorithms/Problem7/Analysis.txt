Problem7:



Design Choice:
Majority of this was spelled out in the problem statement.



Time Complexity:

Insertion - O(n) - where n is the number of path parts/segments in the route

Lookup - O(n) - where n is the number of path parts in the route to look up



Space Complexity: O(m) - where m is the total number of nodes in the trie,
worst case all are unique



Added Test Cases: N/A - was covered
